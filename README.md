# Go vs. Node.js performance test

Hello! This is my project for testing Go vs. Node.js REST API performance. This includes some data manipulations which you can expect (CRUD).

I tried to maintain at least similar file structure to make easier to find the same code in the second language for newcomers.

## Results

In my tests all participants were located in Czech Republic (client and server). Tests were done og Debian 10 machine with nginx 1.14 installed.

## Installation

You should have already prepared server for deployment with some kind of web server like nginx or Apache.
